Avoid the use of abbreviations and acronyms, unless they are listed and described on the legend sheet.\n\n#### ABBREVIATIONS AND CODES\n\nUse abbreviations as long as they are listed on the legend sheet. Use the legend sheet codes for describing systems, materials and finishes.\n\n#### FONT SIZE\n\nThe minimum recommended height of the characters is 2.0mm when printed at full size. Detail titles should be 3.5mm high. The general rule is that the text has to remain legible (without a magnifying glass) when reduced to half size.\n\n#### TEXT ORIENTATION\n\nTo maintain legibility and uniformity, any text on a drawing has to be either horizontal or rotated 90° counterclockwise:\n\n![04-image](notes/1_Principles/assets/04-image.svg)\n\n#### DO NOT ADD NOTES SUCH AS ‘AS SPECIFIED’, ‘AS SCHEDULED’ OR ‘REFER TO ENGINEERS DETAILS’\n\nEvery component of the project is either specified or scheduled or documented by other consultants. Notes like that are redundant and potentially hazardous, as the works may be missing from other documents.\n\nWhen issuing an instruction, follow the examples below.\nAvoid repeating specification information on drawings and details.\n\nExamples:\n\nUse the active voice of verbs rather than the passive:\nDO NOT USE: TO BE PAINTED TO MATCH EXISTING\nPREFERRED: PAINT TO MATCH EXISTING\n\nBe assertive in using commands rather than weaker instructions:\nDO NOT USE: HAND WASH BASINS SHOULD NOT BE REMOVED\nPREFERRED: DO NOT REMOVE HAND WASH BASINS\n\nPhrase directions around action verbs rather than abstract nouns\nDO NOT USE: UTILISATION, ALIGNMENT, AVOIDANCE, PROTECTION\nPREFERRED: USE, ALIGN, AVOID, PROTECT\n\nSpeak directly to contractors rather than saying what they might do\nDO NOT USE: WINDOW FRAMES TO BE REMOVED AND OPENINGS MADE GOOD BY DEMOLITION CONTRACTOR\nPREFERRED: REMOVE WINDOW FRAMES AND MAKE GOOD OPENINGS\n\nAvoid double negatives\nDO NOT USE: DO NOT INSTALL UNLESS APPROVED\nPREFERRED: INSTALL APPROVED SYSTEM","lastmodified":"2023-03-04T23:13:29.345413167Z","tags":null},"/notes/1_Principles/Codes":{"title":"Codes","content":"Codes provide a link between a detail, a long description on the legend sheet and the full description in the specification.\n\n#### BENEFITS\n\n- Codes increase flexibility, efficiency and accuracy and accommodate design changes during the Construction Documentation phase. For instance:\n\t- A portion of a façade is given the code CLAD-2 and described on the legend sheet as ‘COMPOSITE ALUMINIUM SANDWICH PANEL’. CLAD-2 as description will be frequently used in numerous parts of the Architectural Drawing Set.\n\t- Should the cladding change to ‘PATTERNATED STAINLESS STEEL PANEL WITH BACKING BOARD’, only the CLAD-2 description on the legend sheet and to the specifications needs to be updated, the description elsewhere in the drawing set does not need to change.\n\t- Only the legend sheet and specifications need to be re-issued and the rest of the drawing set is automatically up-to-date.\n- Specification writers prefer code because it gives them an all-inclusive listing of systems, materials and finishes, and consequently assures completeness of the specifications.\n\n#### SYSTEMS, MATERIALS AND FINISHES CODES\n\nA system is a set of parts that perform a specific function within a building. It consists of a number of selected building elements, assembled together in a pre-determined configuration, e.g. EXTERNAL WALL CLADDING SYSTEM, DRAINAGE SYSTEM, RAISED FLOOR SYSTEM\n\nMaterial category describes in generic terms what a building element is made of – e.g. METAL, TIMBER, PLASTERBOARD, RECONSTITUTED STONE\n\nFinish describes the required appearance of a material – e.g. HONED, POLISHED, MATT, GLOSS, BLUE, PINK\n\nThe use of ‘systems’ rather than ‘materials’ is often beneficial, since it generally offers greater flexibility.\n\n#### ABBREVIATIONS\n\nThe legend sheet also lists abbreviations used in the Architectural Drawing Set. Abbreviations are a shortened form of a word used in the annotation. \n\nEg SYM is short for SYMMETRICAL\n\n‘Codes’ should not be confused with ‘abbreviations’.","lastmodified":"2023-03-04T23:13:29.345413167Z","tags":null},"/notes/1_Principles/Codes-Examples":{"title":"Codes - Examples","content":"This is a list of codes for describing commonly used systems, materials and finishes. Some projects may require special or new codes, this list is to be used as a common starting point for developing the codes specifically tailored to your project. If you need to allocate a new code, make sure the combination of the letters is derived from generic description of the item and is intuitively recognisable by the user.\n\nCodes ending with ‘S’ commonly refer to systems, as in EXTERNAL WALL SYSTEM.\n\nAvoid nominating proprietary products.

Once decided, the size of paper must remain consistent.\nDo not mix the sizes of paper within the set.\n\n#### The General Storyboard\n\nBreak the drawing set into drawing groups as per the SpA Alphabet. Design the storyboard at A3 size. This becomes the skeleton of your future drawing set.

It communicates to the contractor comprehensive representation of the future building. The architectural drawing set incorporates listing of all codes used to describe the building through detailed description of the architectural entities. The architectural drawing set includes relevant ‘assembly of elements’ schedules.\n\n#### Architectural Specifications\n\nThe _architectural specification_ is a written document with technical directions and conditions describing the quality of materials and standard of workmanship of a project. It deals with items that are not shown on drawings or ‘assembly of elements’ schedules.\n\n#### Architectural Entity\n\nArchitectural Entity (e.g. Reception, Main Entrance, Classroom, External Wall, Auditorium) is a collection of selected building elements (e.g. timber slats, metal studs, plasterboard sheets, coats of paint, ceiling tiles, etc.), assembled together in predetermined configuration.\n\nThe above definitions highlight the Architectural documentation paradox:\n\nDrawings = architectural entities\nSpecifications = trade packages\n\n#### Complete Information\n\nWe do not subdivide our drawing set to document isolated information specific to individual trades.\n\n#### Concentrate on Architecture\n\nThe design intent is expressed through providing:\n- Dimensional setting-out of visible surfaces\n- Definition of materials\n- Definition of finishes\n\nEverything else (i.e. structural design of fixings, internal profiling of aluminium extrusions, exact number of rubber blades within a gasket, etc.) is either in the job description of specialist consultants, contractors, construction managers, etc\n\n#### Describing Architectural Entities\n\nThe _architectural drawing_ set describes the architectural entities of the project through a set of continuously upgraded documents, regardless of what any contractor, at any stage, may wish to separate into a trade package.\n\n#### Specification\n\nArchitectural specification is presented as a sequence of trades. The specification forms part of the tender and contract documents.\n\n#### Tracking of Revisions\n\n- Cloud the changes\n- Show a revision triangle with revision number\n- Write brief description of changes in the description column\n- avoid meaningless descriptions like ‘GENERAL REVISIONS’\n\n#### Communication\n\nDepending on the type of contract, we are often commissioned by the client to act as a _lead consultant_, which places on us the responsibility to coordinate the design information of the entire design team. The clarity of communication between us and the other consultants, and the clear delineation between our and their information is crucially important for the success of the documentation stage of the project.\n\nDo not repeat other consultant’s design information on our drawings.","lastmodified":"2023-03-04T23:13:29.345413167Z","tags":null},"/notes/1_Principles/Legend-Sheet":{"title":"Legend Sheet","content":"The legend sheet provides the key to reading all graphics, abbreviations, codes and symbols used within the architectural drawing set.\n![01-image 1](notes/1_Principles/assets/01-image%201.svg)\n\nThe legend sheet is an essential part of the drawing set.\n\nThe most important part is the list of codes.

That piece of information is of a very little use to anyone and very difficult to keep accurate.\n\nThe same detail may be referenced from multiple locations in the project which would mean you need to list in every instance the origin of the detail.

A101\n\nThe **Discipline designator** helps to identify the type of work that is included on the sheets. Since sheets are distributed to the different sub-contractors in the field, it is helpful for the drawings to be organized by discipline. SpA only produces drawings designated 'A'\n\nThe **Sheet Types designator** organizes drawings into categories - generally from most general to most specific or specialised. Since plans are most helpful to see the overall design of the project, they come first. Elevations and sections are a bit more specific and come next followed by details and schedules, which are the most specific type of drawings.\n\nSheet Types designators used for spaceagency drawings are:\n0 - General: Symbol legend, abbreviations, general notes\n1 - Plans\n2 - Elevations\n3 - Sections\n4 - Large Scale Drawings: plans, elevations, sections (NOT details)\n5 - Details\n6 - Schedules and Diagrams\n7 - User Defined\n8 - Room Layouts and Elevations\n9 - 3D drawings: isometric, perspective, photos\n\nThe final component of the sheet number is the two-digit **sequence number**, which is between 01 and 99. The sequence numbers do not have to be sequential so that space may be left within the set for future additions.\n\n#### Example Sheet Numbers\n\nA107 - Architectural Floor Plan, seventh sheet\nA204 - Architectural Elevations, fourth sheet\n\n### The SpA Alphabet Method\nThe Alphabet method relates to the groups of drawings described in the SpA Alphabet. It is more suitable for larger, more complex projects that require a greater range of drawings to desribe the project.\nDrawing numbers are composed using the following designators:\n\n**(Discipline).(SpA Alphabet Series).(Sequential Number)**\neg.

Additional information (2D elements, labels, dimensions, text, etc) is added directly into the source view on a separate layer(s) (eg. 5 Details for 1:10 and 1:5 detail drawings).\n\nA detail **source** marker is placed on the source view, using the layer of the plan or section that it will appear on (eg. 5 GA Plans, 5 GA Markers). \nThe detail generated by the source marker is placed on a layout.\nThis workflow creates detail content that is in the correct relative position in the BIMx model.\n\nAny editing of the detail in the detail view should be avoided as it would break the direct connection to the model. All changes should be made in the model-based source view (floor plan or section), and the detail updated using the 'rebuilt from model' option.\n\n## Workflow##\n\n![Pasted image 20230131155116](notes/4_ArchiCAD/_assets/Pasted%20image%2020230131155116.png)\n\nStep 1\nSetup a model-based source view (most typically a floor plan or a section) with the appropriate settings (i.e. layer combination, scale, pen set, model view, graphic override, renovation status, partial structure display)\n*Note: In the spaceagency ArchiCAD template amplified views are already set up for Plan and Section Details (1:5 or 1:10) as well as Stair Drawings (1:25).*\n\nStep 2\nIn the source view, add additional information and enhance the graphic representation of the detail. Associative labels and dimensions are useful to display more information about the elements and their properties. Other 2D elements can be added to enhance the detail with additional elements that are rarely modelled, such as screws, membranes, etc. 2D Elements from the libraries can be useful here, too. Ensure that these elements are placed on the appropriate detail layers (eg. *5 Details*), which are not shown on the high-level general arrangement views.\n\nStep 3\nCreate a detail view by placing a **source marker** with the *Detail Tool* on the area we want to show in this view. To transfer all the 2D data we have placed on the source view into our detail view, make sure to untick the ‘Copy construction elements only’ option in the Detail Settings.\nIt is essential to work only in the source view when adding more data or making changes, never in the final detail view. After finishing or updating the enhancements and annotations, the detail must be rebuild from source view.\n\nStep 4\nSave a viewpoint of the detail and place it on a layout.\n\nADVANTAGES\n- As the source view of the generated detail still has a live relation to the model, the detail view will always reflect any model changes, as long as it is correctly rebuilt from the source view.    \n- All documentation is stored in the same file (unless a split model/layout book strategy is used to manage file sizes in large projects). \n- All model information can be used as a basis for detail information.\n- Element properties can be queried (e.g. using Labels) in the source view, not in the detail view.  \n- Consistency among all views: floor plans, sections, elevations, details.\n- Convenient for transferring information between similar details, allowing for graphical consistency across the co-located details.\n- A detailed model means better ability to schedule information.\n- Easier management of details through naming and numbering.\n- Easier navigation with the use of source markers, auto-referencing is possible.\n- Smaller file size, as details are placed on layouts, not cropped views.\n- Details have correct relevant positions when exported in BIMx.\n- Best suited for generating the first level (1:20) of details.\n\nDISADVANTAGES\n- Anytime there is a change in the model, we must update all the placed 2D elements on the source views of the details, too.\n- Details have to be updated to reflect the changes from the model source views.\n- Additional layers and layer combinations are needed for elements visible only on the detailing scale.\n- Solid white fills are sometimes required to hide information at the margins of the detail so that notes and dimensions can be added.\n- Results in a larger Project Map tree, requiring a consistent and logically-structured naming convention to be adopted by the project.\n- Generating both levels of details (1:20 and 1:5) using this method can become confusing.\n- Not ideal for generating 1:5 details, when these are standardised across the office and not project-specific.","lastmodified":"2023-03-04T23:13:29.60942282Z","tags":null},"/notes/4_ArchiCAD/A50a2-3D-Document-Detail":{"title":"A50a2 3D Document Detail","content":"Another way of creating detail documentation based on the model is with the use of 3D Documents (3DD). 3DDs are 3D-based, but static documentation views, projected from a floor plan or a 3D window, which enable us to add dimensions, labels and graphical enhancements. This output can be more descriptive and understandable for contractors than a standard 2D detail drawing; it can still be part of a standard documentation set. \nWe can display properties, classifications and other associated information using associative labels. 3DD-specific features include the ability to display hidden lines of elements, shadows and dimensioning of any plane in the 3D view.\n\n![Pasted image 20230131161223](notes/4_ArchiCAD/_assets/Pasted%20image%2020230131161223.png)\n\nStep 1\nIsolate a section of the model in a 3D view (perspective or axonometric) or a floor plan using the cutting planes and/or Marquee Tool.\n\nStep 2\nCreate a 3D Document from that view.

Multiple detail drawings can be derived from a single view; then again, one view can be a single drawing source but show more details at once. \n\nDepending on how we arrange the placement of the detail drawings from views to layouts, we can use three layout techniques: \n\n[#1. One source view – one drawing](#1.%20One%20source%20view%20%E2%80%93%20one%20drawing)\n[#2. One source view – multiple drawings](#2.%20One%20source%20view%20%E2%80%93%20multiple%20drawings)\n[#3. Multiple source views – Multiple drawings](#3.%20Multiple%20source%20views%20%E2%80%93%20Multiple%20drawings)\n\n## 1. One source view – one drawing ##\n\nThis technique is characteristically used with the creation of a detail library or a series of related details (eg. Door Frame Types). Details are created in a single location (independent detail or worksheet) next to each other, in the same way they would look on a layout. A single viewpoint is created, which is placed on the layout as a single drawing. A separate detail drawing numbering for each detail is not available. Detail titles and numbering needs to be managed manually.\n\nIt can be time-consuming to find a specified detail, as detail markers cannot be used to navigate in the project. This is particularly true when the detail/worksheet viewpoint is not well organised and contains active, superseded, unfinished details, etc. \n\nThis method is suitable for generic details that do not have a specific relationship to the live model, such as generic joinery details, door frame types and elevations, railings, detailed profiles, and practically drawn details that would never be modelled, or those that require quick edit. Developing detail variations is also easy as we can easily transfer information and modify similar elements between details.\n\n![Pasted image 20230202091307](notes/4_ArchiCAD/_assets/Pasted%20image%2020230202091307.png)\n\n## 2. One source view – multiple drawings ##\n\nThis technique is also suitable for detail libraries, but it is used with any method were we create several details in one view. One source view transforms into multiple drawings on the layout where we crop the placed viewpoint to show only one detail at a time. Therefore the viewpoint is added multiple times to the same or different layouts in the Layout Book.\n\nIn comparison to the previously described technique, where we created a single drawing from a single source view, project files can be larger, as we are adding the same view multiple times to a layout. However, the main advantage is the use of ARCHICAD Drawing titles and automatic ID numbers of the cropped drawings placed on the layout. Linked markers can be used after the drawings are placed on the layouts to reference the detail from any other view in the project. \nThis technique will secure less views in the View Map tree, but it produces more cropped drawings on the layout. Therefore, this method should be used sparingly on medium to large projects.\n\n![Pasted image 20230202091404](notes/4_ArchiCAD/_assets/Pasted%20image%2020230202091404.png)\n\n## 3. Multiple source views – Multiple drawings ##\n\nWith this technique, each detail is created in its own view, typically a detail view, sometimes a section or worksheet view. Ideally, these views are generated from the model, as described in [Model-based with Detail viewpoint](notes/4_ArchiCAD/A50a1%20Model%20based%20detail%20with%20viewpoint.md) workflow, and each detail is then individually placed onto a layout. \nThis is the most commonly used layout technique with all types of detailing workflows (model-based, 2D drawn-based and standard detailing) and is essential for any detail that is referenced from other project views (eg. GA plans or sections).\nIt ensures a direct model relationship to details and the ability to navigate the View Map, Layouts Views and BIMx via detail markers and detail numbering.\n\n![Pasted image 20230202091420](notes/4_ArchiCAD/_assets/Pasted%20image%2020230202091420.png)\n\n\nReferences:\n[](https://help.graphisoft.com/AC/26/INT/index.htm?rhcsh=1\u0026rhnewwnd=0\u0026rhmapid=#t=_AC26_Help%252F070_Documentation%252F070_Documentation-99.htm%7CArchiCAD%2026%20Helpcentre%20%3E%20Layout%20and%C2%A0Drawing%20IDs)\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-04T23:13:29.60942282Z","tags":null},"/notes/4_ArchiCAD/__ArchiCAD-Workflows":{"title":"ArchiCAD Workflows","content":"\n- [A50 Details](notes/4_ArchiCAD/A50%20Details.md)\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-04T23:13:29.60942282Z","tags":null},"/notes/5_Sustainable-Action-Plan/01_Introduction":{"title":"01_Introduction","content":"spaceagency have developed this Sustainability Action Plan (SAP) as part of signing onto the Architects Declare commitment in January 2020.\nThis SAP is part of our practice’s commitment and approach to sustainable design, and an actionable strategy for developing best practice, evaluating progress and communicating our values to clients and peers.\n\nThe SAP is a roadmap for spaceagency to:\n\n● Prioritize energy performance, carbon reductions, and resilience in our work, with the goal of moving our entire project portfolio towards carbon neutral buildings, developments, and renovations by 2030.\n● Transform our approach to sustainable design and our working process to be holistic and evidence driven in order to meet the 2030 targets.\n● Measure the carbon impacts of our design decisions, assess progress across our firm’s portfolio and in relation to our peers.\n● Advocate for sustainable design with clients, consultants, and our peers.\n● Train employees, and develop a robust culture of knowledge sharing and continuous learning.\n● Track operations with the goal of achieving carbon neutral operations by 2030.  \n\nWe recognise that is is essential that we all do dramatically more to urgently reconsider how and what we build and replenish our planet’s capacity to thrive.

We recognise this as our top priority to meet the critical climate challenge of reducing the global temperature increase to a maximum +1.5°C._**\n\nThe following pages outline how we intend to achieve this objective and our immediate strategy for action. \n\nWe are committed to raise awareness of the need for sustainability as a ‘minimum standard’ within our industry, including our clients, suppliers, consultants, contractors and building users. It starts with raising the issue at the feasibility and concept phases of the design process and maintaining clear goals with the consultant team throughout design development and documentation. Upon project completion, it continues by integrating information or visually expressing the regenerative strategies for the building users, and by presenting completed projects to peers and sharing lessons learned.\n\nWe advocate for faster industry change and carbon emission reduction by asking our suppliers to recognise and minimise the impact of their products and giving priority to those who do. We continue to be as visible as we can in the current discussions and forums that highlight issue of climate change and demand industry change.\n\nWe champion upgrade, re-use and recycling, rather than demolishing and re-building. We find that the greater co-ordination challenges are offset, not just by cost and material savings, but by more unique and place specific solutions. We thrive on the thoughtful co-ordination between existing and new elements.\n\nWe are establishing mitigation principles to counter climate change and biodiversity loss. Our goal is for all future projects to achieve sustainability ratings, at minimum, from established organisations such as NABERS, WELLS and Green Star, but preferably more holistic and rigorous such as One Planet Living and the Living Building Challenge. To achieve this goal we evaluate each project using various analytical tools, rich contextual research and project team collaboration to create individualised solutions using the most suitable sustainability strategies.\n\nThe inclusion of life-cycle costing, carbon modelling, and post-occupancy evaluation are not currently standard, but we are reviewing available tools to best provide the data we need.\n\nThis collaboration and life-cycle analysis goes hand-in-hand with the desire to reduce material and resource waste, and carbon emissions across the whole-of-life cycle of our buildings, from design to occupation and finally de-commission.\n\nWe are committed to establishing a regenerative design strategy within the next five years, so that regenerative design principles will become an essential part of all our projects.\n\nSUSTAINABLE DESIGN OBJECTIVES:\n\n**1. REDUCED EMISSIONS THROUGH PRESERVATION \u0026 ADAPTIVE RE-USE**\nThe greenest building is one that is already built. Preserving and re-using existing buildings avoids a considerable portion of the embodied carbon emissions associated with equivalent new construction, building materials, and site development, as well as associated transportation emissions over the life of the project.\n\n**2. LASTING VALUE THROUGH HIGH-PERFORMANCE DESIGN**\nLow- and no-cost passive design strategies - like thermal envelope, controlled solar gain, daylighting, and natural ventilation - combined with efficient MEP systems and on- or off-site renewable energy resources, yield new buildings and major renovations that prioritise human comfort and dramatically reduce operational emissions and expenses for the owners and communities they serve.\n\n**3. INCREASED RESILIENCE THROUGH CARBON-SMART CONSTRUCTION**\nThoughtful approaches to renewable materials, supply chains, and methods of construction can minimise cost, dramatically reduce carbon footprints, and support local labor and regional manufacturing. Designing buildings to be durable assets and to anticipate inevitable change, eventual deconstruction, and the re-use of their components ensures that they can support the institutions and communities they are a part of, for generations to come.","lastmodified":"2023-03-04T23:13:29.669425013Z","tags":null},"/notes/5_Sustainable-Action-Plan/03_Approach":{"title":"03_Approach","content":"To achieve these ambitious sustainability objectives, it will be necessary to transform our design practice in a way that is:\n\n**HOLISTIC**\nAchieve total carbon reductions through an integrated approach to addressing operational carbon, embodied carbon, and carbon associated with transportation of building users.\n\n**EVIDENCE BASED**\nUse baselines, strong targets, iterative modelling, and regular review of project data to evaluate our design decisions and measure progress towards carbon reduction targets.\n\n**PROJECT-WIDE**\nApply new sustainable design processes to all projects, so that we can collectively learn, share, and apply lessons learned across the practice’s project portfolio and to future work.\n\nThis will be a journey.  \n\nOutlined below is a design process that will fully apply to all spaceagency projects within 3 years.

Targets for energy use and embodied carbon are calculated as percentage reductions from established baselines for similar project types. All projects should set firm targets for:\n\n• Predicted energy use intensity, or a target lighting power density or interior remodels not involving HVAC.\n• A project carbon budget, expressed in kgCO2e.\n\n2. INTEGRATE PROJECT TEAMS \u0026 DESIGN PROCESSES\n\nA holistic approach to sustainable design entails sharing project targets and engaging all consultants and project stakeholders in collaboration, early and throughout the project delivery process. Tools for this include:\n\n• Project briefs to establish and communicate project objectives, basis of design, and commissioning requirements with all parties.\n• Design workshops or green charrettes, particularly with MEP consultants to advance creative solutions for energy and water efficiency, and with structural engineers for reducing embodied carbon.\n\n3. INTEGRATE DESIGN \u0026 CONSTRUCTION CONSERVATION STRATEGIES\n\nEarly design decisions have the greatest impact on building energy use and embodied carbon. Strategies to pursue first include:\n\n• Connected, transit-oriented, dense, and/or urban infill sites.\n• Preservation, adaptive re-use, minimising the amount of new construction.\n• Building form and orientation, thermal envelope, daylighting, window/ wall ratio, solar shading, natural ventilation, and other low- or no-cost passive design strategies.\n• Choosing mass timber, earthen building where possible, and eliminating or optimising the amount of concrete, steel, and aluminium used in building core and shell.\n\n4. INTEGRATE CLEAN, EFFICIENT TECHNOLOGY \u0026 CARBON SMART MATERIALS\n\nTo compliment and further advance carbon reductions achieved through initial design and construction conservation measures:\n\n• Integrate right-sized, high-efficiency MEP systems and advanced controls.\n• Advocate for building electrification for occupant health and to eliminate all on-site burning of fossil fuels.\n• Specify healthy, renewable, low-carbon and/or carbon sequestering interior materials.\n\n5. OFFSET REMAINING ENERGY DEMANDS \u0026 EMBODIED CARBON\n\nAfter exhausting efficiency and reduction strategies, pursue renewable energy resources and carbon sequestration strategies:\n\n• Incorporate on-site and/or off-site renewable energy production to meet the remaining energy demands.\n• Use site and landscape design strategies for carbon sequestration and reduction.\n\n6. EVALUATE, TRACK, \u0026 REPORT\n\nEngage in early and iterative modelling to understand the interactive effects of design decisions and assess progress toward meeting energy use and embodied carbon targets. This includes:\n\n• Energy modelling for design and compliance.\n• Conducting a whole building life-cycle assessment (LCA).\n• Verify targets are being met through commissioning, ongoing monitoring, and during construction procurement.","lastmodified":"2023-03-04T23:13:29.669425013Z","tags":null},"/notes/5_Sustainable-Action-Plan/04_Evaluation":{"title":"04_Evaluation","content":"You cannot manage what you do not measure.

We aim to complete multiple projects with carbon neutral operations by 2025, and achieve carbon neutral construction in projects by 2030.\n\n**EVALUATION \u0026 REPORTING**\n\nWe are developing the means to conduct early design phase energy modelling and simulation for energy efficiency, thermal comfort, photovoltaics, and lighting. Design decisions can be iteratively assessed relative to EUI targets established at project start.\n\nWithin the next year, we will advance our ability to conduct whole building LCA early and throughout the design process.\n\nKey project metrics - pEUI and carbon budget relative to target values - will be transparent within the firm and across project teams, and will increasingly become a critical dimension of design excellence at spaceagency. \n\nWe will expand our engagement with energy and green building consultants for advanced modelling for code and/or certifications, as well as to pursue greater insight and collaboration in effective carbon mitigation throughout the design process.

Spaceagency is committed to supporting our team with the knowledge, training, and resources they need to be successful in our commitment to meeting the 2030 targets.\n\n**ADVANCED TOOL \u0026 SOFTWARE TRAINING**\n\nSpaceagency will continue to develop knowledge around energy modelling, and LCA software, share resources and lessons learned, and formulate methods for mentoring other project team members.\n\n**CREDENTIALING \u0026 CONTINUING EDUCATION**\n\nAll employees, and especially registered architects, are strongly encouraged to pursue lectures, webinars, and conference training on energy use, decarbonisation, and resilient design and planning for continuing education credits. More specialised training related to sustainability within our areas of practice, such as sustainable housing and preservation, environmental justice for Aboriginal communities, etc. is also encouraged. spaceagency will support employees in pursuing Passive House, Living Future, or other professional certifications.\n\n**OPERATIONS**\n\nIt is meaningful for us to demonstrate our commitment to reducing GHG emissions through all aspects of how we do business. The measure of these actions may be small relative to that of our entire project portfolio, but they are impactful at the local level, and foster sustained awareness of and advocacy for climate action among our team, consultants, and clients.\n\nAs part of our 2030 commitment, we will begin tracking and auditing our firm’s carbon footprint on an annual basis, with the goal of achieving carbon neutral operations and zero waste by 2025.\n\nWe intend to advance our sustainability mission and reduce emissions from our practice’s operations in the following three key areas.\n\n1. TRANSPORTATION\n\nTransportation is responsible for more than 25% of Australian GHG emissions annually, and is potentially a significant contributor to our firm’s carbon footprint.\n\nOur studio is in a walkable urban neighbourhood. More than 75% of our team members walk, bike or take public transit to the studio.\n\nWe commit to reduce our transportation emissions as follows:\n\n• Minimise project-related motor vehicle travel by using virtual meeting platforms whenever possible.\n• Further reduce commuter transportation through flex and remote work policies.\n• Continue to encourage employees to use alternative transportation.\n• Minimise transportation related to errands and deliveries by combining local trips and online supply orders.\n\n2. ENERGY USE\n\nWe commit to reduce emissions from building operations as follows:\n\n• Track and routinely audit utility use at both offices (electricity and water).\n• Reduce plug loads by upgrading desktops computers and servers to laptops and cloud-based servers when and wherever possible. Select ENERGY STAR certified computers, copiers, printers and appliances to replace equipment that is more than 5-10 years old.\n• Purchase renewable energy or renewable energy credits (RECs), as well carbon offsets for onsite fossil fuel use.\n\n3. MATERIALS\n\nOur practice uses software to track and bill all printing, which greatly reduces unnecessary paper use. We have eliminated the use of single-serving bottled water and recycling programs are in place for paper, glass, plastics, and metals. We use toilet and tissue paper from Who Gives A Crap, an Australian supplier that uses 100% recycled products and donates profits for social good.\n\nWe commit to reducing our material use and waste stream as follows:\n\n• Further reduce printing by encouraging the use of pdf software for drawing markups, and phasing out printed marketing materials and business cards.\n• Order office supplies from local suppliers whenever possible.\n• Purchase environmentally friendly cleaning supplies, and select paper and paper products with a minimum of 30% recycled content.\n• Eliminate the use of disposable plastic cutlery and styrofoam food containers.\n• Refuse unnecessary product literature and samples from manufacturers, and inquire about take-back programs for materials that are no longer needed.\n• Donate and/or recycle all no longer used office electronics, furnishings and supplies.","lastmodified":"2023-03-04T23:13:29.669425013Z","tags":null},"/notes/5_Sustainable-Action-Plan/07_Our-Vision":{"title":"07_Our Vision","content":"**Carbon positive buildings.**\n\nThe climate crisis is real and we need to take urgent and drastic action to limit global warming.\n\nThe construction industry is a major contributor to environmental impact, and it’s now imperative we take action.

While sustainable design aims for carbon neutral buildings, we need to do more to restore and not just sustain.\n\nRegenerative development is defined as “a process by which cities, towns, and other human communities bring themselves back into life-giving alignment with the ecological systems that support them. As a practice, it seeks to create a built environment and human systems that are capable of co-evolving with nature”\n\n![LESS ENERGY](notes/5_Sustainable%20Action%20Plan/_assets/LESS%20ENERGY.png)\n\nSource: Development of a regenerative design model for building retrofits, Craft et al. Developed from Bill Reed, 2007\n \n\n**TOOLS TO GET US THERE**\n\nThere are a number of frameworks and initiatives to measure environmental efficiency as it relates to buildings. The more widely known are:\n\nLife-cycle Assessment (LCA) is emerging as one of the most functional assessment tools used to calculate cradle-to-grave environmental impacts associated with a building. LCA’s consist of a series of modules to assess impacts at various stages of a project. LCA’s are standardised by International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) \n\nWhole Life Carbon Assessment is a hybrid LCA assessment encompassing assessments that measure embodied and operational carbon for the life of a building.\n\nNABERS\n\nRating system for a building’s consumption of energy + water, and emissions of carbon + waste. F+P commonly use this on many projects. This is a good measure of operational carbon.\n\nGreen Star\n\nVoluntary rating tool that measures energy, water and material use in buildings, as well as indoor environment quality. Spaceagency are increasingly using this tool in collaboration with specialist consultants\n\nInternational Well Building Institute\n\nA voluntary global tool measures a building’s performance in human health and wellness. \n\nLiving Building Challenge\n\nGreen building certification and sustainable design framework, currently regarded the most rigorous pathway to sustainable building accreditation.\n\nPassive House Institute\n\nIndependent research institute involved in the development of the Passive House concept, internationally recognised, performance based energy standard in construction.\n\nZero Carbon 2030\n\nA global initiative to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2030, through economic influence.\n\n**THE IMPACT OF OUR BUILDINGS**\n\nWhile it is evident there are far reaching environmental impacts from the construction sector, operating and embodied energy (or carbon emissions) are of particular concern due to their immediate relationship to global warming and climate breakdown.\n  \n![Energy use 45-50](notes/5_Sustainable%20Action%20Plan/_assets/Energy%20use%2045-50.png)\n  \n\nEmbodied energy (the energy expended to produce and transport a product) can be as high as 40% of a building’s total energy consumption across a 50 year lifespan. Below are some of the ‘big hitters’ when it comes to embodied energy in materials, shown with comparative values (MJ/kg):\n\n170 Aluminium \n32 Steel  \n5.6 Cement\n3.6 AAC (Autoclaved aerated concrete) \n70 PVC \n12.7 Glass\n2.5 Bricks\n\nSource: https://www.yourhome.gov.au/materials/embodied-energy\n\nOperational energy, (the energy required to operate a building) accounts for the remaining 60% of energy - and therefore carbon - produced over the lifetime of a building. Approaches to reduce operational carbon emissions include reduction and offsetting. At spaceagency we see offsetting as a last resort, only to be entertained when every other avenue to minimise embodied carbon has been exhausted.\n\nThe table below shows the relative contribution over the life cycle of a building. \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\nSource: Whole-of-life Embodied Carbon Emissions Reduction Framwork.

Establish climate and biodiversity mitigation principles as the key measure of our industry’s success: demonstrated through awards, prizes and listings.\n\n1.  Evaluate all new projects against the aspiration to contribute positively to mitigating climate breakdown, and encourage our clients to adopt this approach. \n2.  Upgrade existing buildings for extended use as a more carbon efficient alternative to demolition and new build whenever there is a viable choice. \n3.  Include life cycle costing, whole life carbon modelling and post occupancy evaluation as part of our basic scope of work, to reduce both embodied and operational resource use. \n4.  Adopt more regenerative design principles in our studios, with the aim of designing architecture and urbanism that goes beyond the standard of net zero carbon in use. \n5.  Collaborate with engineers, contractors and clients to further reduce construction waste. \n6.  Accelerate the shift to low embodied carbon materials in all our work. \n7.  Minimise wasteful use of resources in architecture and urban planning, both in quantum and in detail. \n\n**CURRENT PRACTICE**\n\nWhen delivering a project, we strive to ensure it not only meets its design and as-built ratings, but that it encompasses spaces designed to global best- practice wellness standards, and that each project is a highly efficient and productive asset.\n\nKey to achieving the highest targets is the fundamental understanding of passive design principles from site selection to building orientation, window location, shading, insulation and thermal mass, as well as the principles of re- use rather than demolition.\n\nBeyond this, Fitzpatrick+Partners works with our clients to devise a tailored set of solutions to optimise the developments carbon impact from both embodied and operational pathways. Our aim is to deliver buildings that are truly regenerative not merely minimising carbon but actively giving more than they take.\n\nRegenerative design requires an integrated approach with a strong emphasis upon teamwork. The quality and experience of the consultant team makes an enormous difference to the level of strategic thinking brought to every project.\n\n**OUR FUTURE**\n\nOur practice already considers our sustainable ratings and awards as success indicators. However, we will highlight them in our literature and prioritise suppliers and consultants who also have ‘green’ awards and principles in our ‘green spec matrix’. This matrix will include sustainable products, suppliers and materials, prioritised by their ‘green performance’.\n\nFor all future projects, we will work towards implementing our F+P building performance targets, irrespective of whether the client chooses to formally pursue a Green star rating.\n\nF+P will also establish an evaluation framework for each of the architectural project phases to ensure that we take every opportunity to improve our sustainability output, both in quantum and detail, on all future projects. Our evaluation will cover areas including: energy and material use, polluting emissions, life cycle costing, waste production and occupant wellness.\n\nF+P are currently researching regenerative design principles and plan to establish an analytical process and design strategy for inclusion in all future projects to mitigate environmental damage. This will include the identification of and collaboration with Aboriginal culture and heritage on all future projects. We work towards regenerative design underpinning our design approach. We will also collate regenerative suppliers for inclusion within our ‘green spec matrix’.\n\n\n**EVALUATION + REPORTING**\n\n**RELEVANT ARCHITECTS DECLARE PRINCIPLES**\n\n1.  Share knowledge and research to that end on an open source basis. \n2.  Evaluate all new projects against the aspiration to contribute positively to mitigating climate breakdown, and encourage our clients to adopt this approach. \n\n7. Include life cycle costing, whole life carbon modelling and post occupancy evaluation as part of our basic scope of work, to reduce both embodied and operational resource use.\n\n1.  Accelerate the shift to low embodied carbon materials in all our work. \n2.  Minimise wasteful use of resources in architecture and urban planning, both in quantum and in detail.\n\n**CURRENT PRACTICE**\n\nCurrently our studio relies on tools such as Green star and NABERS to evaluate and report on the environmental performance of a project. This is undertaken by clients who elect to finance this assessment and currently encompasses most of our projects.\n\nHowever, the post occupancy information from Green Star is currently not shared with the studio, and is an avenue that we can utilize in the future, to better understand the performance of our buildings.\n\nBuilding Challenge and Passive House standards are currently under investigation to improve the studio’s regenerative design approach for future projects.\n\nWe are currently reviewing various modelling software that assist to evaluate energy modelling, life cycle costing, as well as evaluation of materials and carbon.\n\n**OUR FUTURE**\n\nAll new projects will be evaluated to understand the environmental impacts and reduce them as much as possible. This will include energy modelling and life cycle costing, as well as evaluation of materials, carbon + waste reduction, and post occupancy data. Once we have finalised the best software to evaluate these aspects, this information will be collated for all projects.\n\nThis ‘impact evaluation process’ (IEP) will be tailored to each project phase, and formulated with the input from suppliers, consultants and contractors in a series of collaborative, cross-discipline workshops. The evaluation will determine areas of resource consumption and waste generation during the architectural process (design to construction to de-commission) and how it can be reduced. The IEP will be used for all future projects, and will guide more project-specific discussions with the team about both areas for improvement in both quantum and detail.\n\nF+P already advocates re-use of buildings where practical, but one of the complexities comes from integrating the existing works with new works. This requires better survey information and access to site at early stages of the design process.\n\n**OUTREACH + ADVOCACY \n\n**RELEVANT ARCHITECTS DECLARE PRINCIPLES**\n\n1.  Raise awareness of the climate and biodiversity emergencies and the urgent need for action amongst our clients and supply chains. \n2.  Advocate for faster change in our industry towards regenerative design practices and a higher Governmental funding priority to support this. \n\n4. Share knowledge and research to that end on an open source basis.\n\n**CURRENT PRACTICE**\n\nAs a studio, we define the sustainable principles that we subscribe to within our EOI documents. This outlines our commitment from the outset so clients are clear about our sustainable and regenerative principles.\n\nMany of our projects currently are designed to Green Star or NABERS standards, a testimony to the value that those clients place on sustainability.\n\nIn the future, we intend to provide greater education to clients to make better and more informed decisions around sustainable and regenerative design.\n\nOur practice contributes to the greater sustainable design community through numerous ways. Partner, Paul Reidy participates on the NSW Steering Committee for Architects Declare. Many of our staff are passionate about sustainable design and have formed an in-house sustainability group to move the studio into a net zero future.\n\n**OUR FUTURE**\n\nWe always raise sustainability with our clients, but the supply chain awareness can be improved by lobbying our major suppliers for sustainable alternatives. We will request their sustainability action plans and prioritise the suppliers and products with greatest sustainability merits for all future projects. Part of addressing this principle is developing and utilizing the ‘green spec. matrix’ we’re currently developing.\n\nOnce we have or regenerative design strategy in place for our future projects, we will be able to share our knowledge and experience with our peers, and advocate for the issue with our clients, consultants, contractors, and even building users.\n\nOur studio is also committed to sharing our sustainable knowledge and research in an open source. We will be continuing our involvement with Architects Declare, and creating literature for peers and clients. This literature will include a handbook, outlining best practice regenerative and sustainable principles, and champion successful examples of completed projects to demonstrate the value of these design principles.\n\n\n**TRAINING + EDUCATION** \n\n**RELEVANT ARCHITECTS DECLARE PRINCIPLES**\n\n2.

This program will cover all areas of sustainability to ensure a comprehensive and holistic approach.\n\nOnce our studio has a good base level of understanding in these areas, our staff will be trained in the use of the supporting software and evaluation tools, where in-house use is proposed. Along with this training and the recommended databases and contacts we will be able to deliver the most suitable environmental outcome.\n\nWe will also formalise our ‘green’ leaders as champions for sustainable design, and our future pursuits of regenerative design. These green leaders will research and collaborate on educational literature which will be shared, both internally and externally, which outline methods, materials and products that reduce and reverse environmental impact.\n\nFitzpatrick + Partners doesn’t currently design with regenerative principles in any significant capacity. Part of our pledge to implement regenerative design in our studio’s output includes internal education. Our sustainability champions will collaborate with green experts and resources to prepare an internal design guide. This design guide will implement a cohesive overall strategy across the studio for all new projects.\n\nWe will also require all studio staff to complete courses and expert presentations with a focus on sustainability topics.\n\n\n**OPERATIONS + OUTLOOK \n\n**RELEVANT ARCHITECTS DECLARE PRINCIPLES**\n\n1.  Share knowledge and research to that end on an open source basis. \n2.  Evaluate all new projects against the aspiration to contribute positively to mitigating climate breakdown, and encourage our clients to adopt this approach. \n\n  \n\n**OUR FUTURE**\n\nHaving completed our carbon footprint audit, we will publicly share this on our website for transparency and reference for our peers. This goes hand-in-hand with our future research, literature and design strategies.\n\nTo further reduce our carbon footprint, we’ll be implementing the following strategies by end of 2021:\n\n1.  Accelerate the shift to low embodied carbon materials in all our work. \n2.  Minimise wasteful use of resources in architecture and urban planning, • Encourage web-meetings where possible to reduce travel \n\nboth in quantum and in detail.\n\n• Provide enhanced mark-up software to enable 100% electronic flow of information and minimize printing.\n\n  \n\n**CURRENT PRACTICE** • Implement 100% computer shut-down at the end of each day\n\nThe studio is in the fortunate position to have moved to new premises and provided an opportunity to review and implement new sustainable studio practices. For our new studio fitout, we evaluated its impact and prioritised suppliers and contractors who aligned with our own sustainability values, kick- starting the process of raising awareness with our suppliers, and providing an example to show our clients of achievable, sustainable choices that we stand by.\n\nSome of the sustainability improvements to operations captured in the new fitout are:\n\n• Auditing the carbon footprint of the studio  \n• Utilising 100% certified green energy  \n• Open planning to encourage natural lighting  \n• Renewable finishes such as Tasmanian Oak flooring throughout • New energy efficient lighting throughout\n\n• All kitchen appliances are energy star rated\n\n• High quality bespoke and ergonomically design joinery to provide robustness, longevity and health + well-being.\n\n• Studio-wide waste recycling\n\n• “Kind” soap + cleaning products\n\n• EOT facilities\n\n• De-materialisation of the fitout by removing the use of ceilings for the main studio space.\n\n• Minimise the use of plasterboard  \n• Designing bathrooms to a tile dimension to remove tile waste\n\n• Monitor and publish energy usage in-house to reduce.\n\n• Engage cleaning staff to use green cleaning products.\n\n• Source carbon neutral suppliers for all office supplies\n\n• Go Carbon Neutral and purchase carbon emission offsets, where required.\n\n• Encourage staff to review superannuation funds, to choose those that limit investment in fossil fuels (Australian Ethical, CARE Super, Future Super, Verve Super)\n\n  \n\n\n**SUSTAINABILITY AT SPACEAGENCY**\n\n**WHO ARE WE?**\n\nSpaceagency are leaders in providing sustainable solutions for the built environment. Sustainability has always been a driving force in our approach to building design. We don’t believe that sustainability is something which is governed by a rating tool, but is the result of investigation and implementation of sustainable principles intrinsically embedded into the design process.\n\n  \n\n**WHAT WE PROMOTE**\n\nWe focus on promoting a sustainable agenda from the concept design through to the project realisation on site, with the aim of finding solutions which take us towards a regenerative architecture that restores the natural environment.\n\n  \n\n**WHAT WE ACCOMPLISHED SO FAR**\n\nSpaceagency practice ‘silent sustainability’. Passive solar design, adaptive reuse, material selection, efficient operation, divestment from harmful artificial materials have been part of our design process for many years and lead to a body of work that is inherently ‘sustainable’. We have adopted and promoted sustainable design principles,  the beginnings of an extensive portfolio of sustainable built work. Green star, as well as NABERS and WELL ratings are now common place on projects in our office.\n\nOur studio includes a core group of staff who are champions of sustainable and regenerative design and are actively researching and collaborating to develop new systems, approaches and products within the field. As a part of this research Fitzpatrick + Partners has invested significantly in the research and development of CLT and other engineered timber. CLT not only has the biophilic benefits of a natural material, but it has a lower embodied energy per KG than most other building materials.\n\n**WHAT WE ARE WORKING TOWARDS**\n\nAs a part of our commitment to a Sustainable Future we embrace the principles of Regenerative Design, specifically designing net zero and carbon positive buildings, and seek to make all of the projects in our portfolio regenerative by 2030. This date has been established as critical to reduce the impact our buildings have on climate change, and to minimise the harmful effects of global warming.\n\n**HOW WE WILL BUILD A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE**\n\nTo achieve this, we have created a Sustainability Action Plan which outlines the critical steps that we, as architects, must take to make Regenerative Design a cornerstone of all of our projects.\n\nCritically, we recognise that while we can be an advocate for sustainable design principles, we cannot do this alone. Our success is dependent on having industry wide recognition of the importance of this issue and collaboration towards realising a Sustainable Future.\n\nIn short, we depend on the entire community to recognise the unique challenge we are facing and to buy in to a Sustainable Future.\n\n**_Creating a sustainable future is the challenge of our generation. As architects, we are in a unique position to affect the built environment on a scale that can make a significant impact on our planet._**\n\n**_We believe that it is our responsibility to provide ethical, thoughtful, environmentally sensitive and well designed buildings for the benefit of our clients, our community, and our planet._**","lastmodified":"2023-03-04T23:13:29.669425013Z","tags":null},"/notes/6_Just-Organisation/JP1.1-Gender-Diversity-and-Inclusion":{"title":"JP1.1 - Gender Diversity and Inclusion","content":"**Written by**: Tobias Busch\n**Checked by**:\n**Date**:\n**Level achieved**:\n\n# Policy\n(Note: below is a joint policy for Ethnic Diversity, Gender Diversity and Inclusion metrics)\n\nSpaceagency recognises the value of a diverse workplace is committed to fostering an inclusive environment. Our human capital is the most valuable asset we have. The collective sum of the individual differences, life experiences, knowledge, inventiveness, innovation, self-expression, unique capabilities and talent that our diverse employees invest in their work represents a significant part of not only our culture, but our reputation, goodwill and long-term success. We aim to create a welcoming, supportive, and collaborative environment where full participation is valued and voices from diverse backgrounds and perspectives are heard. \n\nWe recognise, embrace and celebrate our employees’ differences in age, colour, race, ethnicity, family or marital status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, language, national origin, physical and mental ability, political affiliation, religious affiliation, socio-economic status, citizenship status and other identities that make our employees unique. \n\nOur core principles are to encourage: \n\n- Respectful communication and cooperation between all employees \n- Teamwork and employee participation, permitting the representation of all groups and employee perspectives \n- Work/life balance through flexible work schedules to accommodate employees’ varying needs \n- Employer and employee contributions to the communities we serve to promote a greater understanding and respect for traditionally underserved and historically marginalised populations \n- Acceptance of cultural, religious or personal beliefs and practices \n\nWe are focused on providing a culture and work environment where racially and ethnically diverse employees have the opportunity to be successful in their careers and to be represented at all levels of the organisation including senior leadership. \n\nWe are taking steps to provide a culture which does not limit opportunities provided to all women, both trans and cis, and are committed to ongoing mentorship and sponsorship of all women employees. Gender diversity may also include individuals who identify as non-binary or gender non-conforming. We are accepting of all members of LGBTIQ+ communities and endeavour to ensure that opportunities for success are not limited by identity. \n\nWe are an equal opportunity employer and endeavour to support any staff with disabilities and/or health needs, including mental health, and recognise our responsibilities to make reasonable adjustments to the workplace or working arrangements so that our employees can do their job safely and effectively. \n\nAll employees of DesignInc have a responsibility to treat others with dignity, empathy, kindness, courtesy and respect at all times. All employees are expected to exhibit conduct that reflects inclusion during work, at work functions, on or off the work site and at all other organisation-sponsored and participative events. Behaviour, actions or words that transgress the policy will not be tolerated and will be dealt with in line with the practice’s disciplinary procedure. \n\nAs a practice we aim to provide an inclusive, diverse and supportive environment through: \n\n- Gender pay equity \n- Flexible and part-time work availability \n- Discouraging ‘long hours’ culture \n- Supporting career breaks \n- Supporting career progression \n- Providing mentorship + role models \n\nDesignInc is a proud member of the Male Champions of Change program and is committed to actively advancing gender equity in our practice and profession. Guided by the Australian Institute of Architects Gender Equity Taskforce, DesignInc commits to meet the expectation of the 40:40:20 Campaign: 40 per cent women, 40 per cent men, and 20 per cent discretionary employees. \n\n## Additional Support / Context\n\nDesignInc recognises the contemporary challenges which face women and those from minorities both within the profession and within broader social and cultural spheres. We note the stark contrast between the diversity of Australian society and the diversity of Australian leadership. \n\nIn Australia, women have made up nearly half of all architecture graduates since the mid-1990s. Yet women make up just 25 percent of all registered architects and 13 percent of all directors. DesignInc currently (Oct 2019) comprises 56 percent women employees. DesignInc Senior Leadership currently (Oct 2019) comprises 17 percent women. \n\n32 percent of Australians have a non-Anglo-Celtic background, yet they only accounted (in 2016) for five percent of ASX 200 CEOs, four percent of federal parliamentarians, and fewer than two percent of senior positions in federal and state public service departments. They occupied zero university vice-chancellor positions and zero federal ministerial positions. Meanwhile, those with an Anglo-Celtic background filled between 76 and 86 percent of roles in the same categories. \n\nAustralian 2016 Census concluded that 28.5 percent of people living in greater Melbourne have a non-Anglo-Celtic (white) background. Approximately 36 percent of people living in greater Melbourne were born somewhere other than Australia. Australia’s racial minority are Aboriginal peoples, Torres Strait Islanders and South Sea Islanders, with the community in greater Melbourne at less than 1 percent (0.6%). \n\nDesignInc conducted an ethnic diversity exercise in which staff shared their family background and place of birth. Approximately 35 percent of staff identified as being of a non-Anglo-Celtic background. Approximately 34 percent of staff identified as being born somewhere other than Australia. Currently no one at DesignInc identifies as Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander or South Sea Islander. \n\nAfter conducting an internal survey, we report an average staff inclusion score of 7.65 out of 10. \n\n## Supporting Procedures or Policies\n\n1.

We use both formal and informal methods to ensure employee engagement. We aim to employ open and honest communication and provide staff with regular and constructive feedback. Project and team meetings provide opportunities for staff to understand and be involved in decisions that affect their work. Regular in-house tutorials and workshops are also available to staff for training and development. \n\nOur formal appraisal process comprises two parts: The Preview, and the Retrospective + 360 Feedback. Occurring at the beginning of each year, the Preview presents staff with an opportunity to set goals for the coming twelve months. These aspirations are discussed with a supervisor to ascertain the training and development opportunities that may be required. The Retrospective + 360 Feedback is a performance review that occurs in the middle of each year. This process involves an exchange between staff who provide feedback on each other’s performance. This reflexive approach provides staff with helpful and honest feedback to advance their professional development. We hope that these methods combine to form a workplace culture of openness, trust and support in which all employees feel engaged. \n\nWe aim to achieve employee engagement by continuingly promoting and working to improve the following areas:\n\n+ Clear job descriptions which are linked to the wider team and organisation goals which show employees how their role contributes to the wider strategic objectives.\n+ Diversity such as ethnic, gender, age and sexual orientation and creating a culture of inclusion and participation.\n+ Family friendly policies such as working from home and flexible working hours.\n+ Work life balance.\n+ Performance based compensation reward and recognition programs.\n+ Environmental sustainability.\n+ Learning and Development including provision of study assistance.\n+ Career progression and support.\n+ Interesting and challenging work that grows our employees experience and capabilities.\n+ Creating a working environment which is free from harassment and where everyone is treated with dignity, courtesy and respect.\n+ Social Events.\n+ Mental Health support and promotion.\n- Regular open and honest communication and feedback.\n- Regular performance reviews offering an ongoing opportunity for employees and managers to plan, monitor and review employee’s work objectives and overall alignment and contribution to the wider strategic business goals. This provides an open communication platform between employees and managers about what the employee is expected to accomplish, while also enabling conversations around employee learning and development and career progression.\n+ Support to implement the latest industry technological advancement to improve our work performance.\n\n## Additional Support / Context\n\nAfter conducting an internal survey, we report that xx% of staff feel engaged.   \n\n## Supporting Procedures or Policies\n\n\nReferences:\n\n\nLinks:","lastmodified":"2023-03-04T23:13:29.669425013Z","tags":null},"/notes/6_Just-Organisation/JP2.1-Full-time-Employment":{"title":"JP2.1 - Full-time Employment","content":"**Written by**: Tobias Busch\n**Checked by**:\n**Date**:\n\n# Metric\n\n**Level achieved**: Level 1 (2) 3 4\n**Description**\n1.  Organisation has written and posted public policy on full-time employment. \n2.  Organisation has a minimum of 80 percent of its total workforce meeting the full-time employment definition.\n\n# Policy\n\nSpaceagency is committed to providing permanent full-time and part-time employment as the primary basis of our workforce. We understand the value in offering our employees stable, on-going employment with full benefits.\n\nAll employees are hired on a permanent, full-time employment agreement with the exception\n\nof temporary staff hired on an adhoc casual basis and architecture and interior design student interns on work\n\nexperience placement from university.\n\nSpaceagency does not employ paid or unpaid interns.\n\nSpaceagency believes that flexible working arrangements may be important for work / life balance of some employees and encourage all staff to pursue working arrangements which best suit their needs. Examples of reasons staff have pursued alternate working arrangements: \n- Interest in other creative pursuits \n- Personal health and/or wellbeing reasons \n- Personal business opportunities \n- Parental care \n- Family support / care \n- Tutoring/ Lecturing \n- Involvement in industry related conference, board, panel participation \n- Involvement in industry related research projects \n\nExamples of flexible arrangements available to all employees include: \n- Condensed work weeks (e.g. four 10-hour workdays) \n- Customised working hours (e.g. 7am to 3pm workday) \n- Telecommuting (e.g. employees work one or two days a week from home)  \n\nWe support career breaks and parental leave and are working to tackle the problem of ‘false part-time syndrome’ for part-time employees. We actively discourage all employees from working unpaid over-time. All over-time must be pre-agreed and will be reimbursed as Time-In-Lieu or paid overtime as specified by the Architects Award. \n\n## Additional Support / Context\n\nSpaceagency has a total of 6 staff as of March 2022. Of this total 2 are employed on a part-time basis. \n\n**Permanent Full-time Employees** work 37.5 hours per week, as per the employee agreement. Permanent full-time employees are eligible for all leave, overtime, flexible working arrangements and superannuation benefits set out in the employment agreement. \n\n**Permanent Part-time Employees** work fewer than 37.5 hours per week and are eligible for all flexible working arrangements and overtime benefits as well as pro-rated leave and superannuation benefits. \n\n**Fixed Term Contract Employees** are employed for a specific period or task. For example, a 6-month contract where employment ends after 6 months. Fixed term contract employees are usually full-time or part-time employees. Full-time or part-time fixed term employees are entitled to the same wages, penalties and leave as permanent employees as described in the employee agreement. \n\n**Casual Employees** do not have a firm commitment in advance from an employer about how long they will be employed for, or the days (or hours) they will work. A casual employee also does not commit to all work an employer might offer. Casual employees are entitled to a higher pay rate than equivalent full-time or part-time employees. This is called a 'casual loading' and is paid because they do not receive benefits such as sick or annual leave. A casual employee can change to full-time or part-time employment at any time if the employer and employee both agree to it.\n\n## Supporting Procedures or Policies\n\n1.

We recognise the right to collective bargaining is the key to the representation of collective interests. It builds on freedom of association and renders collective representation meaningful. Collective bargaining can play an important role in enhancing enterprise performance, managing change and building harmonious employer-employee relations. \n\nSpaceagency employees have the right to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection, and they also have the right to refrain from any or all such activities except to the extent that such right may be affected by an agreement requiring membership in a labour organisation as a condition of employment. Employees of spaceagency will not be discriminated against due to membership and participation in labour unions.\n\n## Additional Support / Context\n\nSpaceagency as a practice is a member of both the Association of Consulting Architects (ACA) and the Australian Institute of Architects (AIA). The ACA is an employer-representative and leads the discussion on business and employment matters in Australian architecture. The AIA is the peak body for the architecture profession in Australia representing over 11,500 members globally and dedicated to improving the built environment and communities by promoting quality, responsible, sustainable design.  \nProfessional Architects Australia is the employee-representative union for architectural workers, providing legal representation and collective bargaining for members. \n\n## Supporting Procedures or Policies\n\n\nReferences:\n\n\nLinks:","lastmodified":"2023-03-04T23:13:29.669425013Z","tags":null},"/notes/6_Just-Organisation/JP2.4-Living-Wage":{"title":"JP2.4 - Living Wage","content":"\nLevel 4\n\n# Policy\n\nSpaceagency is committed to providing a minimum of a Living Wage for all employees.

Pay classes with no gender diversity can be excluded. Pay classes with fewer than four employees can be excluded.\n\n**Gender Pay Gap** \n\nSpaceagency commits to transparency of its Gender Pay Gap (GPG). The GPG measures the difference between the average earnings of women and men in the workforce. It is not the difference between two people being paid differently for work of the same or comparable value.\n\nThe GPG is an internationally established measure of women’s position in economy in comparison to men. It is the result of the social and economic factors that combine to reduce women’s earning capacity over their lifetime. \n\nSpaceagency’s GPG is 18% (male adv) \n\n**Interpreting the Gap** \n\nOur pay gap is not an equal pay issue. Men and women are paid equally for doing equivalent jobs across the practice. \n\nAt spaceagency the gender pay gap is influenced by several factors, including: \n\n– higher number of women working part-time \n\n– higher number of men in senior, higher-paid roles\n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n**Supporting Procedures or Policies**\n\n1.

A 2010 AIHW report found that 96% of working-age Australians had at least one chronic disease risk factor and 72% had multiple risk factors. The modifiable risk factors causing the greatest disease burden are tobacco smoking, alcohol misuse, poor diet, physical inactivity and unhealthy weight. As major contributors to chronic disease, these risk factors lead to reduced productivity and participation in the workforce and the community and place great pressure on the Australian healthcare system. There is also a recognised two-way causal relationship between many of these risk factors and mental disorders such as depression.\n\nThe benefits of physical health are supported by compelling evidence from National and International studies.\n\nA study undertaken by Medibank Private revealed that:\n- Organisations that implement health promotion strategies in the workplace can reduce their workers’ health risk factors by up to 56%;\n- Productivity gains of up to 15% can be achieved by upgrading the workplace environment; and\n- The average worker is up to 7% less productive because of their health risks.\n\n  \n\n## Supporting Procedures or Policies\n\n1.

The Australian Government determines the Super Guarantee rate which, in 2021, is set at 10% of OTE. OTE generally includes the employee's regular wage plus any shift loadings, commissions, paid leave and some allowances. Superannuation must be 'preserved' until your preservation age which is currently between 55 and 60, depending on when you were born. When you reach preservation age, you can access your super as long as you are permanently retired (or reached age 65).\n\nWhen you have reached retirement age and stop working, your super fund is usually converted to a pension which will give the employee money to live on.\n\n## Supporting Procedures or Policies","lastmodified":"2023-03-04T23:13:29.669425013Z","tags":null},"/notes/6_Just-Organisation/JP4.3-Family-and-Medical-Leave":{"title":"JP4.3 - Family and Medical Leave","content":"**Written by**: Tobias Busch\n**Checked by**:\n**Date**:\n\n# Metric\n\n**Level achieved**: Level (1) 2 3 4\n**Description**\n1.

In order to better safeguard the welfare of animals and to develop a higher level of empathy for their plight, we support the following policies and practices: \n\n-   Provide a companion / support animal friendly workplace \n-   Give preference to specifying non-animal-based materials and products in our work \n-   Ensure catering menus for internal and external functions are at least 50 percent plant-based. If the menu is not 100% plant-based, supplemental menu items must be plant-forward and contain only certified humane animal products \n-   Purchase supplies, materials and ingredients that have not been tested on animals \n-   Do not conduct any animal testing or experimentation \n-   Do not engage in business with services or companies that participate in the abusive treatment of animals, animal testing or factory farm facilities. \n\n## Additional Support / Context\n\n## Supporting Procedures or Policies\n\nReferences:\n\n\nLinks:","lastmodified":"2023-03-04T23:13:29.669425013Z","tags":null},"/notes/6_Just-Organisation/JP5.4-Charitable-Gifting":{"title":"JP5.4 - Charitable Gifting","content":"**Written by**: Tobias Busch\n**Checked by**:\n**Date**:\n\n# Metric\n\n**Level achieved**: Level (1 2) 3 4 ?\n**Description**\n1.

You can find the bulk of the configuration scattered throughout the repository depending on how in-depth you'd like to get.\n\nThe majority of configuration can be found under `data/config.yaml`.

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems? Checkout our [FAQ and Troubleshooting guide](notes/troubleshooting.md).\n\n## Language Support\n[CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) comes out of the box with Quartz.\n\nWant to support languages that read from right-to-left (like Arabic)? Hugo (and by proxy, Quartz) supports this natively.\n\nFollow the steps [Hugo provides here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages) and modify your `config.toml`\n\nFor example:\n\n```toml\ndefaultContentLanguage = 'ar'\n[languages]\n  [languages.ar]\n    languagedirection = 'rtl'\n    title = 'مدونتي'\n    weight = 1\n```\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-04T23:13:29.669425013Z","tags":null},"/notes/custom-Domain":{"title":"Custom Domain","content":"\n### Registrar\nThis step is only applicable if you are using a **custom domain**!

You should set the environment variable `HUGO_BASEURL=http://your-public-ip` and then start your container.\n2. Set up port forwarding on your router from port `p` to `your-local-ip:1313`.\n3. You should now be able to access Quartz from outside your local network at `http://your-public-ip:p`.\n\nHowever, your HTTP connection will be unencrypted and **this method is not secure**.\n\n### To a Domain using Cloudflare Proxy\n\n1. Port forward 443 (HTTPS) from your machine.\n2. Buy a custom domain (say, `your-domain.com`) from [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/). Point a DNS A record from `your-domain.com` to your public IP address and enable the proxy.\n3. Set the environment variables `HUGO_BASEURL=https://your-domain.com`, `HUGO_PORT=443`, and `HUGO_APPENDPORT=false`. Change `1313:1313` to `443:443` for the `ports` in `docker-compose.yml`.\n4. Spin up your Quartz container and enjoy it at `https://your-domain.com`!\n\n### To a Domain using a Reverse Proxy\n\nIf you want to serve more than just Quartz to the internet on this machine (or don't want to use the Cloudflare registrar and proxy), you should follow the steps in the section above (as appropriate) and also set up a reverse proxy, like [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik).

You can organize content into any folder you'd like.\n\n**To edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.**\n\nTo create a link between notes in your garden, just create a normal link using Markdown pointing to the document in question. Please note that **all links should be relative to the root `/content` path**. \n\n```markdown\nFor example, I want to link this current document to `notes/config.md`.\n[A link to the config page](notes/config.md)\n```\n\nSimilarly, you can put local images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\nYou can also use wikilinks if that is what you are more comfortable with!\n\n### Front Matter\nHugo is picky when it comes to metadata for files. Make sure that your title is double-quoted and that you have a title defined at the top of your file like so. You can also add tags here as well.\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"Example Title\"\ntags:\n- example-tag\n---\n\nRest of your content here...\n```\n\n### Obsidian\nI recommend using [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md/) as a way to edit and grow your digital garden.

If you forked and cloned Quartz directly from the repository, everything should already be good to go! Follow the steps below.\n\n### Enable GitHub Actions\nBy default, GitHub disables workflows from running automatically on Forked Repostories. Head to the 'Actions' tab of your forked repository and Enable Workflows to setup deploying your Quartz site!\n\n![Enable GitHub Actions](notes/images/github-actions.png)*Enable GitHub Actions*\n\n### Enable GitHub Pages\n\nHead to the 'Settings' tab of your forked repository and go to the 'Pages' tab.\n\n1.

Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as if it were just a regular software project.\n\n```shell\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\ncd \u003cpath-to-quartz\u003e\n\n# Commit all changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\n\n# Push to GitHub to update site\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`. \n\nMake sure that your `baseURL` has a trailing `/`!\n\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n```\n\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing `/`. **You need to do this especially if you are using GitHub!**\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz/\"\n```\n\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml {title=\".github/workflows/deploy.yaml\"}\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain?

This is easier to setup but usually produces lower quality matches.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nenableSemanticSearch: false\n```\n\n## Natural Language\nNatural language search is powered by [Operand](https://beta.operand.ai/). It understands language like a person does and finds results that best match user intent. In this sense, it is closer to how Google Search works.\n\nNatural language search tends to produce higher quality results than full-text search.\n\nHere's how to set it up.\n\n1. Login or Register for a new Operand account. Click the verification link sent to your email, and you'll be redirected to the dashboard. (Note) You do not need to enter a credit card to create an account, or get started with the Operand API. The first $10 of usage each month is free. To learn more, see pricing. If you go over your free quota, we'll (politely) reach out and ask you to configure billing.\n2. Create your first index. On the dashboard, under \"Indexes\", enter the name and description of your index, and click \"Create Index\". Note down the ID of the index (obtained by clicking on the index name in the list of indexes), as you'll need it in the next step. IDs are unique to each index, and look something like `uqv1duxxbdxu`.\n3. Click into the index you've created. Under \"Index Something\", select \"SITEMAP\" from the dropdown and click \"Add Source\".\n4. For the \"Sitemap.xml URL\", put your deployed site's base URL followed by `sitemap.xml`. For example, for `quartz.jzhao.xyz`, put `https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/sitemap.xml`. Leave the URL Regex empty. \n5. Get your API key. On the dashboard, under \"API Keys\", you can manage your API keys. If you don't already have an API key, click \"Create API Key\". You'll need this for the next step.\n6. Open `data/config.yaml`. Set `enableSemanticSearch` to `true`, `operandApiKey` to your copied key, and `operandIndexId` to the ID of the index we created from earlier..\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nsearch:\n  enableSemanticSearch: true\n  operandApiKey: \"jp9k5hudse2a828z98kxd6z3payi8u90rnjf\"\n  operandIndexId: \"s0kf3bd6tldw\"\n```\n7.

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup analytics?\nQuartz by default uses [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) for analytics. \n\nIf you would prefer to use Google Analytics, you can follow this [guide in the Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/templates/internal/#google-analytics). \n\nAlternatively, you can also import your Google Analytics data into Plausible by [following this guide](https://plausible.io/docs/google-analytics-import).\n\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide.
