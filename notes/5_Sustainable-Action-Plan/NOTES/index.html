Our aim is to deliver buildings that are truly regenerative not merely minimising carbon but actively giving more than they take.</p><p>Regenerative design requires an integrated approach with a strong emphasis upon teamwork. The quality and experience of the consultant team makes an enormous difference to the level of strategic thinking brought to every project.</p><p><strong>OUR FUTURE</strong></p><p>Our practice already considers our sustainable ratings and awards as success indicators. However, we will highlight them in our literature and prioritise suppliers and consultants who also have ‘green’ awards and principles in our ‘green spec matrix’. This matrix will include sustainable products, suppliers and materials, prioritised by their ‘green performance’.</p><p>For all future projects, we will work towards implementing our F+P building performance targets, irrespective of whether the client chooses to formally pursue a Green star rating.</p><p>F+P will also establish an evaluation framework for each of the architectural project phases to ensure that we take every opportunity to improve our sustainability output, both in quantum and detail, on all future projects. Our evaluation will cover areas including: energy and material use, polluting emissions, life cycle costing, waste production and occupant wellness.</p><p>F+P are currently researching regenerative design principles and plan to establish an analytical process and design strategy for inclusion in all future projects to mitigate environmental damage. This will include the identification of and collaboration with Aboriginal culture and heritage on all future projects. We work towards regenerative design underpinning our design approach. We will also collate regenerative suppliers for inclusion within our ‘green spec matrix’.</p><p><strong>EVALUATION + REPORTING</strong></p><p><strong>RELEVANT ARCHITECTS DECLARE PRINCIPLES</strong></p><ol><li><p>Share knowledge and research to that end on an open source basis. </p></li><li><p>Evaluate all new projects against the aspiration to contribute positively to mitigating climate breakdown, and encourage our clients to adopt this approach. </p></li><li><p>Include life cycle costing, whole life carbon modelling and post occupancy evaluation as part of our basic scope of work, to reduce both embodied and operational resource use.</p></li><li><p>Accelerate the shift to low embodied carbon materials in all our work. </p></li><li><p>Minimise wasteful use of resources in architecture and urban planning, both in quantum and in detail.</p></li></ol><p><strong>CURRENT PRACTICE</strong></p><p>Currently our studio relies on tools such as Green star and NABERS to evaluate and report on the environmental performance of a project. This is undertaken by clients who elect to finance this assessment and currently encompasses most of our projects.</p><p>However, the post occupancy information from Green Star is currently not shared with the studio, and is an avenue that we can utilize in the future, to better understand the performance of our buildings.</p><p>Building Challenge and Passive House standards are currently under investigation to improve the studio’s regenerative design approach for future projects.</p><p>We are currently reviewing various modelling software that assist to evaluate energy modelling, life cycle costing, as well as evaluation of materials and carbon.</p><p><strong>OUR FUTURE</strong></p><p>All new projects will be evaluated to understand the environmental impacts and reduce them as much as possible. This will include energy modelling and life cycle costing, as well as evaluation of materials, carbon + waste reduction, and post occupancy data. Once we have finalised the best software to evaluate these aspects, this information will be collated for all projects.</p><p>This ‘impact evaluation process’ (IEP) will be tailored to each project phase, and formulated with the input from suppliers, consultants and contractors in a series of collaborative, cross-discipline workshops. The evaluation will determine areas of resource consumption and waste generation during the architectural process (design to construction to de-commission) and how it can be reduced. The IEP will be used for all future projects, and will guide more project-specific discussions with the team about both areas for improvement in both quantum and detail.</p><p>F+P already advocates re-use of buildings where practical, but one of the complexities comes from integrating the existing works with new works. This requires better survey information and access to site at early stages of the design process.</p><p>**OUTREACH + ADVOCACY</p><p><strong>RELEVANT ARCHITECTS DECLARE PRINCIPLES</strong></p><ol><li><p>Raise awareness of the climate and biodiversity emergencies and the urgent need for action amongst our clients and supply chains. </p></li><li><p>Advocate for faster change in our industry towards regenerative design practices and a higher Governmental funding priority to support this. </p></li><li><p>Share knowledge and research to that end on an open source basis.</p></li></ol><p><strong>CURRENT PRACTICE</strong></p><p>As a studio, we define the sustainable principles that we subscribe to within our EOI documents. This outlines our commitment from the outset so clients are clear about our sustainable and regenerative principles.</p><p>Many of our projects currently are designed to Green Star or NABERS standards, a testimony to the value that those clients place on sustainability.</p><p>In the future, we intend to provide greater education to clients to make better and more informed decisions around sustainable and regenerative design.</p><p>Our practice contributes to the greater sustainable design community through numerous ways. Partner, Paul Reidy participates on the NSW Steering Committee for Architects Declare. Many of our staff are passionate about sustainable design and have formed an in-house sustainability group to move the studio into a net zero future.</p><p><strong>OUR FUTURE</strong></p><p>We always raise sustainability with our clients, but the supply chain awareness can be improved by lobbying our major suppliers for sustainable alternatives. We will request their sustainability action plans and prioritise the suppliers and products with greatest sustainability merits for all future projects. Part of addressing this principle is developing and utilizing the ‘green spec. matrix’ we’re currently developing.</p><p>Once we have or regenerative design strategy in place for our future projects, we will be able to share our knowledge and experience with our peers, and advocate for the issue with our clients, consultants, contractors, and even building users.</p><p>Our studio is also committed to sharing our sustainable knowledge and research in an open source. We will be continuing our involvement with Architects Declare, and creating literature for peers and clients. This literature will include a handbook, outlining best practice regenerative and sustainable principles, and champion successful examples of completed projects to demonstrate the value of these design principles.</p><p><strong>TRAINING + EDUCATION</strong> </p><p><strong>RELEVANT ARCHITECTS DECLARE PRINCIPLES</strong></p><ol start=2><li><p>Advocate for faster change in our industry towards regenerative design practices and a higher Governmental funding priority to support this.</p></li><li><p>Share knowledge and research to that end on an open source basis.</p></li><li><p>Include life cycle costing, whole life carbon modelling and post occupancy evaluation as part of our basic scope of work, to reduce both embodied and operational resource use.</p></li><li><p>Collaborate with engineers, contractors and clients to further reduce construction waste. </p></li><li><p>Accelerate the shift to low embodied carbon materials in all our work. </p></li></ol><p><strong>CURRENT PRACTICE</strong></p><p>Our studio places high priority on knowledge sharing as a way to activate, educate and stimulate new ideas.</p><p>While the studio has entertained a variety of guest speakers to speak in-house over recent times on a range of topics, we also hold in-house meetings to formulate and implement our sustainability action plan.</p><p>In the future we envisage this group to grow to encompass a greater cross- section of the studio and act as a platform to implement our SAP</p><p><strong>OUR FUTURE</strong></p><p>The first step to improving our training and education is the formulation and establishment of an in-house education program. This program will cover all areas of sustainability to ensure a comprehensive and holistic approach.</p><p>Once our studio has a good base level of understanding in these areas, our staff will be trained in the use of the supporting software and evaluation tools, where in-house use is proposed. Along with this training and the recommended databases and contacts we will be able to deliver the most suitable environmental outcome.</p><p>We will also formalise our ‘green’ leaders as champions for sustainable design, and our future pursuits of regenerative design. These green leaders will research and collaborate on educational literature which will be shared, both internally and externally, which outline methods, materials and products that reduce and reverse environmental impact.</p><p>Fitzpatrick + Partners doesn’t currently design with regenerative principles in any significant capacity. Part of our pledge to implement regenerative design in our studio’s output includes internal education. Our sustainability champions will collaborate with green experts and resources to prepare an internal design guide. This design guide will implement a cohesive overall strategy across the studio for all new projects.</p><p>We will also require all studio staff to complete courses and expert presentations with a focus on sustainability topics.</p><p>**OPERATIONS + OUTLOOK</p><p><strong>RELEVANT ARCHITECTS DECLARE PRINCIPLES</strong></p><ol><li>Share knowledge and research to that end on an open source basis. </li><li>Evaluate all new projects against the aspiration to contribute positively to mitigating climate breakdown, and encourage our clients to adopt this approach. </li></ol><p><strong>OUR FUTURE</strong></p><p>Having completed our carbon footprint audit, we will publicly share this on our website for transparency and reference for our peers. This goes hand-in-hand with our future research, literature and design strategies.</p><p>To further reduce our carbon footprint, we’ll be implementing the following strategies by end of 2021:</p><ol><li>Accelerate the shift to low embodied carbon materials in all our work. </li><li>Minimise wasteful use of resources in architecture and urban planning, • Encourage web-meetings where possible to reduce travel </li></ol><p>both in quantum and in detail.</p><p>• Provide enhanced mark-up software to enable 100% electronic flow of information and minimize printing.</p><p><strong>CURRENT PRACTICE</strong> • Implement 100% computer shut-down at the end of each day</p><p>The studio is in the fortunate position to have moved to new premises and provided an opportunity to review and implement new sustainable studio practices. For our new studio fitout, we evaluated its impact and prioritised suppliers and contractors who aligned with our own sustainability values, kick- starting the process of raising awareness with our suppliers, and providing an example to show our clients of achievable, sustainable choices that we stand by.</p><p>Some of the sustainability improvements to operations captured in the new fitout are:</p><p>• Auditing the carbon footprint of the studio<br>• Utilising 100% certified green energy<br>• Open planning to encourage natural lighting<br>• Renewable finishes such as Tasmanian Oak flooring throughout • New energy efficient lighting throughout</p><p>• All kitchen appliances are energy star rated</p><p>• High quality bespoke and ergonomically design joinery to provide robustness, longevity and health + well-being.</p><p>• Studio-wide waste recycling</p><p>• “Kind” soap + cleaning products</p><p>• EOT facilities</p><p>• De-materialisation of the fitout by removing the use of ceilings for the main studio space.</p><p>• Minimise the use of plasterboard<br>• Designing bathrooms to a tile dimension to remove tile waste</p><p>• Monitor and publish energy usage in-house to reduce.</p><p>• Engage cleaning staff to use green cleaning products.</p><p>• Source carbon neutral suppliers for all office supplies</p><p>• Go Carbon Neutral and purchase carbon emission offsets, where required.</p><p>• Encourage staff to review superannuation funds, to choose those that limit investment in fossil fuels (Australian Ethical, CARE Super, Future Super, Verve Super)</p><p><strong>SUSTAINABILITY AT SPACEAGENCY</strong></p><p><strong>WHO ARE WE?</strong></p><p>Spaceagency are leaders in providing sustainable solutions for the built environment. Sustainability has always been a driving force in our approach to building design. We don’t believe that sustainability is something which is governed by a rating tool, but is the result of investigation and implementation of sustainable principles intrinsically embedded into the design process.</p><p><strong>WHAT WE PROMOTE</strong></p><p>We focus on promoting a sustainable agenda from the concept design through to the project realisation on site, with the aim of finding solutions which take us towards a regenerative architecture that restores the natural environment.</p><p><strong>WHAT WE ACCOMPLISHED SO FAR</strong></p><p>Spaceagency practice ‘silent sustainability’. Passive solar design, adaptive reuse, material selection, efficient operation, divestment from harmful artificial materials have been part of our design process for many years and lead to a body of work that is inherently ‘sustainable’. We have adopted and promoted sustainable design principles,  the beginnings of an extensive portfolio of sustainable built work. Green star, as well as NABERS and WELL ratings are now common place on projects in our office.</p><p>Our studio includes a core group of staff who are champions of sustainable and regenerative design and are actively researching and collaborating to develop new systems, approaches and products within the field. As a part of this research Fitzpatrick + Partners has invested significantly in the research and development of CLT and other engineered timber. CLT not only has the biophilic benefits of a natural material, but it has a lower embodied energy per KG than most other building materials.</p><p><strong>WHAT WE ARE WORKING TOWARDS</strong></p><p>As a part of our commitment to a Sustainable Future we embrace the principles of Regenerative Design, specifically designing net zero and carbon positive buildings, and seek to make all of the projects in our portfolio regenerative by 2030. This date has been established as critical to reduce the impact our buildings have on climate change, and to minimise the harmful effects of global warming.</p><p><strong>HOW WE WILL BUILD A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE</strong></p><p>To achieve this, we have created a Sustainability Action Plan which outlines the critical steps that we, as architects, must take to make Regenerative Design a cornerstone of all of our projects.</p><p>Critically, we recognise that while we can be an advocate for sustainable design principles, we cannot do this alone. Our success is dependent on having industry wide recognition of the importance of this issue and collaboration towards realising a Sustainable Future.</p><p>In short, we depend on the entire community to recognise the unique challenge we are facing and to buy in to a Sustainable Future.</p><p><strong><em>Creating a sustainable future is the challenge of our generation. As architects, we are in a unique position to affect the built environment on a scale that can make a significant impact on our planet.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>We believe that it is our responsibility to provide ethical, thoughtful, environmentally sensitive and well designed buildings for the benefit of our clients, our community, and our planet.</em></strong></p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script async src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://SpaceagencyArchitects.github.io/SpA_Styleguide/js/graph.6579af7b10c818dbd2ca038702db0224.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Jacky Zhao using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2023</p><ul><li><a href=https://SpaceagencyArchitects.github.io/SpA_Styleguide/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/_jzhao>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0>GitHub</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
