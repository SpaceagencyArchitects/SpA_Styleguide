### Benefits of Following the SpA Documentation Approach

- Efficient communication of design intent through a legible, simple, clear document
- The focus is on design, buildability and scope, rather than the drafting process
- There is a standardisation of the documentation output of the studio
- It allows an appropriate allocation of project risk
- There is the potential for a reduced number of conflicts and ambiguities, resulting in fewer contractual claims
- There is flexibility to accommodate design changes throughout the construction documentation stage
- Better project outcomes

### Departure from the SpA Documentation Approach

There are many facets to construction documentation and many aspects which influence the way the construction documentation set will evolve. The project and contract type, builder’s preferences, consultant’s preferences, SpA team leader’s preferences, will all play a part in the sculpting of the document. Adjustments to suit a particular project are inevitable.

The decision to depart from the SpA Documentation format is at the discretion of the team leader and will depend on the requirements of the project.

That decision is a matter of professional judgment, informed by the full understanding of the SpA-CART Documentation Concepts and SpA-CART Focus points.

Once  greed, the altered set of rules has to be implemented consistently throughout the set.

### Guides Not Rules

Concepts outlined in this document are principles, not rigid rules. This set of principles provides a base line for tested and efficient ways of completing the project documentation tasks.
