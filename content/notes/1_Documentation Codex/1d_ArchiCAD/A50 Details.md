The ideal detailing workflow is to use the model to extract details with minimal 2D work involved. Although building a model for automatic extraction of details requires good modelling skills and a good understanding of BIM, a huge advantage of model-based detail over pure 2D details is that we can utilise and display information built into the elements: properties, descriptions, classifications -- practically any non-graphical metadata.

We can use different model-based scenarios, or traditional 2D approaches, depending on the project and nature of detail we are conveying:

Model-based:
- [A50a1 Model based detail with viewpoint](notes/1_Documentation%20Codex/1d_ArchiCAD/A50a1%20Model%20based%20detail%20with%20viewpoint.md) 
- [A50a2 3D Document Detail](notes/1_Documentation%20Codex/1d_ArchiCAD/A50a2%203D%20Document%20Detail.md)

2D based:
