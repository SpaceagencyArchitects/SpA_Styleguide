title: "Q - Wet Areas"
---
Typically captured as part of [G - Internal Spaces (Room Layouts)](notes/2_Alphabet/G%20-%20Internal%20Spaces%20(Room%20Layouts).md) series drawings and [L - Furniture, Fixtures, Fittings and Equipment (FFE)](notes/2_Alphabet/L%20-%20Furniture,%20Fixtures,%20Fittings%20and%20Equipment%20(FFE).md) series legend

### WET AREAS LEGEND SHEET

-   Legend sheet - wet areas fixtures and fittings only

(Wet areas fixtures and fittings codes are used exclusively in Q series drawings, on that basis the legend is separated from A and L series legends. Not to be confused with finishes codes e.g. paints and tiles - they are listed in A series general legend.)

### WET AREA PLANS, REFLECTED CEILING PLANS AND INTERNAL ELEVATIONS (1:50, 1:25)

1:50 scale drawings with ‘line of height control diagram’ is commonly sufficient for documentation of the wet areas.

More complex designs require scale 1:20.

-   Grid lines
-   Room names, room numbers and finished floor levels (FFL)
-   Wet areas fixtures and fittings codes
-   Section references referring to K series interface details
-   ‘Enlarged area boxes’ referring to K series interface details
-   Internal elevation references
-   Setting-out points
-   Dimensions and setting-out other than already done in 1:100 E series
