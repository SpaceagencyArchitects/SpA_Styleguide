## A guide to where the information belongs within the drawing set

The SpA Alphabet is a detailed listing of the items we use to describe a building.

The SpA Alphabet breaks the building into drawing groups. Each drawing group of the alphabet contains certain types of information, and is grouped either by scale (**1:100**, **1:50**, etc.), type (elevation, section, etc.), location (core, auditorium, etc.), element (stair, lift, etc.), or by any combination of the criteria best suited for the purpose of describing the building.

The drawing scales assigned to the letters of the SpA Alphabet are prescriptive. If a portion of the drawing (e.g. at **1:100**) becomes graphically too heavy due to small rooms and the required amount of description, draw an ‘enlarged area reference box’, do not show any description within the box at **1:100**, and show description items on a **1:50** detail drawing.
