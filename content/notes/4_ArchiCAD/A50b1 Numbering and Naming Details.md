The reference ID and naming of details should make it easy to navigate the Project and View maps.

IDs and names for detail views should only be set in the Project Map or the marker of the relevant view type.
The ID and names of saved viewpoints in the View Map should **always** be set to 'By Project Map'.

Generally, the format of detail IDs should identify the type of detail and it's source, eg.:
SD-A.01 - section detail 01 on Section A
PD-0.01 - plan detail 01 on the Ground Floor
JD-Bar.01 - Joinery detail
SD-Typ01 - typical section detail
WD-01 - Window detail

Detail names should be concise description of the content of the detail, eg. 'Wall Junction', 'Box Gutter'.

Detail Markers should be set to reference the 'first placed drawing of the selected Viewpoint' and display the viewpoint's 'Drawing ID' and 'Layout Name'.
When placing detail viewpoints on a layout, the Drawing ID should be set to 'By Layout' and Drawing Name to 'By View: Name only'.

This workflow ensures that there is only one location where the detail's ID is controlled (the Project Map), and that cross referencing of details is consistent across all Layouts and drawings.
