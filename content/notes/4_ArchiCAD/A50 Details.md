The ideal detailing workflow is to use the model to extract details with minimal 2D work involved. Although building a model for automatic extraction of details requires good modelling skills and a good understanding of BIM, a huge advantage of model-based detail over pure 2D details is that we can utilise and display information built into the elements: properties, descriptions, classifications -- practically any non-graphical metadata.

We can use different model-based scenarios, or traditional 2D approaches, depending on the project and nature of detail we are conveying:

Model-based:
- [[A50a1 Model based detail with viewpoint]] 
- [[A50a2 3D Document Detail]]

2D based:
- [[A50a4 Drawn Copy of Detail with Source Marker]]
- [[A50a3 Drawn Independent Detail]]

- [[A50a5 Standard Detailing and External Details]]

[[A50b1 Numbering and Naming Details]]
[[A50b2 Detail Layout Techniques]]
