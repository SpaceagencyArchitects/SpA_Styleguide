### Identify Signs

#### B - Floor Plans (1:100)
(see [[B - Floor and Roof Plans]])
- Identify free standing and wall hung signage items

#### E - Reflected Ceiling Plans (1:100)
(see [[E - Reflected Ceiling Plans]])
- Identify ceiling hung signage items
Note: Wayfinding signage elements will be documented by a signage consultant if your job has one - in that case we only do setting-out in B and E series general arrangement plans. Statutory signage (e.g. FIRE DOORS KEEP CLOSED, etc.) is most often associated with the doors and scheduled as part of J series door schedule.
