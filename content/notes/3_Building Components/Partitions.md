### Identify Partitions

#### B - Floor Plans (1:100)
(see [[B - Floor and Roof Plans]])
Note: Blockwork walls are often constructed as full height for the purpose of acoustic or fire protection. If services, e.g. mechanical ducts are going through them, blockwork walls need to be drawn in elevation to set-out the penetrations. For that reason the walls need to be given a unique tag for every straight run of the wall. If there are no penetrations through blockwork walls, a blockwork type code (with corresponding detail) will suffice
- Unique identification tag for each drylining partition type and unique number for every blockwork wall (see NOTE)
- Concrete walls are already documented in V series drawings


### Describe Construction Only

#### A - Legend Sheet
(see [[A - Introductory documents]])
- Key - description of the partition construction code

#### G - Internal Spaces Plans (1:50)
(see [[G - Internal Spaces (Room Layouts)]])
_(If provided - otherwise refer direct from **1:100** plans in B series)_
- Make reference to **1:5** details in K series

#### K - Interface Details (1:5)
(see [[K - Interface Details]])
- Construction of the detail only - do not describe applied finishes e.g. paint, sealant, etc
- (Generic) internal partitions-tointernal partitions plan details _(if required - not needed if it’s common construction)_
- (Location specific) internal partitions-to-external wall plan details
- (Location specific) internal partitions-to-ceiling section details
- (Location specific) internal partitions-to-floor section details
- Do not redraw common details. Make reference to proprietary system in the specification instead.

**Concrete slab thermal insulation**
Depending on the configuration of your building, you may need to provide a reflected ceiling plan of the underside of concrete slabs (to identify areas that need thermal insulation).
