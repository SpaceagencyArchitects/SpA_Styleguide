### Identify joinery items

#### B - Floor Plans (1:100)
(see [[B - Floor and Roof Plans]])
Note: There is a strong preference for identifying joinery items in B series **1:100** general arrangement floor plans.
- Joinery items coded, using codes listed in L series legend

### Describe joinery items

#### L - Joinery Plans (1:100)
(see [[L - Furniture, Fixtures, Fittings and Equipment (FFE)]])
Note:
As a second preference, in the case where coding of joinery items is not practical in B series, use a separate set of general arrangement drawings
This approach creates another subset of **1:100** plans in M series, and is used exclusively to identify joinery and FFE items.
- Joinery items coded, using codes listed in L series legend

### Describe Construction

#### L - Legend Sheet - Joinery and Furniture only
(see [[L - Furniture, Fixtures, Fittings and Equipment (FFE)]])
