### Identify flooring systems and finishes

#### F - Floor Finishes Plans (1:100)
(see [[F - Floor, Wall and Ceiling Finishes]])
- Coded and graphic representation of various flooring systems
- Discrete codes for substrates and for finishes

Note:
In the case where the majority of the floor finishes are too complex to schedule, as a second preference we resort to documenting them through graphic representation. This approach creates another subset of **1:100** plans in the F series, used exclusively to identify floor finishes.

### Describe Construction and Finishes

#### A - Legend Sheet
(see [[A - Introductory documents]])
- Key - description of flooring codes; reference to specification section

#### F - Floor Finishes Plans (1:100)
(see [[F - Floor, Wall and Ceiling Finishes]])
- Complex areas which are graphically too heavy are referenced to **1:50** plans in G series

#### G - Internal Spaces Floor Plans (1:50)
(see [[G - Internal Spaces (Room Layouts)]])
- Describe various areas of different flooring systems, substrates and finishes, using finishes codes
- Make reference to **1:5** details in K series interface details

#### K - Interface Details
(see [[K - Interface Details]])
- Floor-to-external wall composite section details **1:5** _(construction of the detail only - do not describe applied finishes e.g. paint, sealant, etc.)_
- Flooring (floor-to-floor) details **1:5** _(construction of the detail only - do not describe applied finishes e.g. paint, sealant, etc.)_
- Partitions-to-floors interface composite details **1:5** _(construction of the detail only - do not describe applied finishes e.g. paint, sealant, etc.)_
