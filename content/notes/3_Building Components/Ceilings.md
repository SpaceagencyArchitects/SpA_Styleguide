#### F - Room Schedule
(see [[Floors - Room Schedule Scenario]])
_(Covers most of the areas by allocating finishes code. For more complex areas instead of trying to code it, write a note in schedule ‘FOR DETAILS REFER TO DRAWING AR-G-\*\*-\*\*’)_
- Create columns in room finishes schedule: <span class="caps"> CEILING | Material | Finish | Bulkhead | Material | Finish </span>
- Reference complex areas which can not be scheduled to **1:50** reflected ceiling plans in G series

#### E - Reflected Ceiling Plans (1:100)
(see [[E - Reflected Ceiling Plans]])
- Systems and materials codes

#### G - Internal Spaces Reflected Ceiling Plans (1:50)
(see [[G - Internal Spaces (Room Layouts)]])
_(Needed only if graphically too heavy in E series. If required show ‘enlarged area boxes’ referring to an enlarged area in G series. Do not repeat descriptions.)_
- Systems and material codes
- Make reference to **1:5** details in K series

(see [[K - Interface Details]])
- _(generic)_ ceiling-to-ceiling details
- _(location specific)_ ceiling interface with external wall **1:5**
- _(location specific)_ ceiling interface with partitions **1:5**
