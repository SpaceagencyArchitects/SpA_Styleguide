### Identify Wall Protection Systems

#### F - Wall Protection General Arrangement Plans (1:100)
(see [[F - Floor, Wall and Ceiling Finishes]])
- The wall protection items are identified by pointing coded tags to wall surfaces
- Reference to G series drawings for complex areas

Note: 
As a second preference, in the case where the quantity and variation of wall protection systems (e.g. in health care project) would make F series room schedule too complex, we resort to documenting it through graphic representation.
This approach creates another subset of **1:100** plans in the F series, used to
graphically represent and identify wall protection systems:
